## Section 8: Asynchronous Programming and Object-Oriented Programming

As applications become more complex, the need for asynchronous programming and object-oriented design becomes evident. In this section, we will explore asynchronous JavaScript, learning how to handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await. We will also venture into the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), understanding the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These advanced concepts are pivotal for you building sophisticated and scalable applications.
