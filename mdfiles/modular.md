## Modules and ES6 Modules

Modular programming is a technique that promotes breaking down a program into smaller, manageable, and reusable components. In this lesson, we will explore JavaScript modules and ES6 modules, which facilitate modular development.

### Introduction to Modules

Modules are self-contained units of code that encapsulate related functionality. They promote code organization, reusability, and maintainability by allowing developers to isolate different parts of their application.

### Creating and Exporting Modules

In ES6, modules are created by writing separate files, with each file representing a module. You can export values, functions, or classes from a module using the `export` keyword.

[copy code](www.code1.com)
```javascript
// math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Importing Modules

To use exported values from another module, you use the `import` keyword. You can import specific exports or the entire module.

[copy code](www.code2.com)
```javascript
// app.js
import { add } from "./math.js";

const result = add(3, 5); // result = 8
```

### Default Exports

A module can have a default export, which is the main export of the module. It simplifies importing by allowing you to use any name you prefer when importing.

[copy code](www.code3.com)
```javascript
// math.js
export default function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// app.js
import customAdd from "./math.js";
```

### Module Dependencies

Modules can depend on other modules. When importing modules, their dependencies are resolved automatically.

### Browser Support and ES6 Modules

ES6 modules are natively supported in modern browsers. You can use them in the browser by specifying the `type="module"` attribute in your HTML `<script>` tag.

[copy code](www.code4.com)
```html
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
```

### Conclusion

Modules are a powerful tool for organizing and structuring your codebase. They promote reusability, maintainability, and encapsulation. ES6 modules provide a standardized way to work with modules in JavaScript, enabling you to build more modular and scalable applications.
