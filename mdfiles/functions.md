# Functions

## Introduction to Functions

Functions are a core concept in programming. They allow you to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task, making your code more organized, modular, and reusable. Functions play a crucial role in writing maintainable and efficient programs.

## Importance of Functions in Programming

Imagine you're building a complex application with many tasks to perform. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can create functions to encapsulate specific actions. Functions promote code reusability, reduce redundancy, and make debugging and maintenance easier.

## Function Declaration

A function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses `( )`, and a pair of curly braces `{ }` that contain the code to be executed when the function is called.

```javascript
function functionName() {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

## Parameters and Arguments

Functions can receive inputs called **parameters**. These parameters are placeholders for values that you provide when you call the function. Arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when calling it.

[copy code](www.code2.com)
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Return Values

Functions can also return values using the `return` keyword. The returned value can be used in further computations or assignments.

[copy code](www.code3.com)
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(3, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

## Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function are **locally scoped**, meaning they can only be accessed within that function. This concept is known as **function scope**.

[copy code](www.code4.com)
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}

console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
```

## Using Built-In JavaScript Functions

JavaScript provides a variety of built-in functions that perform common operations. For example, `parseInt()` converts a string to an integer, `toFixed()` formats a number with a specified decimal place, and `toUpperCase()` converts a string to uppercase.


[copy code](www.code5.com)
```javascript
let numStr = "42";
let num = parseInt(numStr); // Convert string to integer
console.log(num); // Output: 42

let decimalNum = 3.14159;
let formattedNum = decimalNum.toFixed(2); // Format with 2 decimal places
console.log(formattedNum); // Output: 3.14

let message = "hello world";
let upperCaseMessage = message.toUpperCase(); // Convert to uppercase
console.log(upperCaseMessage); // Output: HELLO WORLD
```

## Writing Your Own Functions

Let's write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

[copy code](www.code6.com)
```javascript
function calculateRectangleArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

let area = calculateRectangleArea(5, 8);
console.log(area); // Output: 40
```

## Conclusion

Functions are essential building blocks in programming. They help organize code, improve reusability, and make programs more modular. By understanding function declaration, parameters, return values, and function scope, you'll be equipped to write efficient and maintainable code. Additionally, using built-in JavaScript functions can enhance your programming capabilities.

## Practice Exercise

Write a function called `isEven` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns `true` if the number is even, and `false` otherwise.
