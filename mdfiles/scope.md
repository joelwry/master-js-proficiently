# Scope and Closures 

In JavaScript, scope refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables and functions within different parts of your code. Understanding scope is crucial for writing organized and efficient code. In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of scope and dive into closures, a powerful concept that relates to scope.

## Scope

### Global Scope

Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the code.

[copy code](www.code1.com)
```javascript
const globalVar = 10;

function exampleFunction() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible inside the function
}

console.log(globalVar); // Accessible globally
```

### Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function have function scope. They are only accessible within that function.

[copy code](www.code2.com)
```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
  const localVar = 20;
  console.log(localVar); // Accessible inside the function
}

console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

### Block Scope

Introduced with ES6 using `let` and `const`, block scope restricts the visibility of variables to the block where they are defined.

[copy code](www.code3.com)
```javascript
if (true) {
  const blockVar = 30;
  console.log(blockVar); // Accessible within the block
}

console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
```

## Closures

A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

[copy code](www.code4.com)
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVar = 40;
  
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from outer scope
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Prints 40
```

Closures are often used for data encapsulation and creating private variables.

[copy code](www.code5.com)
```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: function() {
      count++;
    },
    getCount: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment();
console.log(myCounter.getCount()); // Prints 1
```

## Conclusion

Understanding scope and closures in JavaScript is essential for writing maintainable and organized code. Scopes define where variables are accessible, and closures allow functions to remember their surrounding context. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to write efficient and modular JavaScript code.
