### Setting Up JavaScript Programming Environments


**1) Connecting a JS File to an HTML File:**

To see the output of your JavaScript code in a browser, you can connect it to an HTML file.

1. **Create an HTML File:** Create a new HTML file, like `index.html`, using your preferred code editor.

2. **Write HTML:** In the HTML file, create a basic structure:

   [copy code](www.code1.com)
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>JavaScript in HTML</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script src="myscript.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```


3. **Create a JS File:** Create a new JS file, like `myscript.js`, in the same folder as your HTML file.

4. **Write JavaScript:** Write your JavaScript code in the `myscript.js` file.

5. **Open in Browser:** Double-click the HTML file to open it in your default web browser. To see output of your code in the browser console. Right click any section on the page and click on inspect, navigate to console to view the javaScript code output in the browser's developer console.

Remember, for this method, you're creating a simple HTML page that includes your JavaScript file. This way, you can use the browser's developer tools to see the output and interact with your JavaScript code.This is the simplest way to get started with javascript without any other setup

If you want to go further then we can recommend setting up javascript development using either any of these but are not limited to these.

**2) Using Sublime Text (Without the Browser or HTML Page):**

Sublime Text is a lightweight and versatile code editor. It help provide syntax highlighting. To use it for JavaScript programming without a browser or HTML page:

1. **Install Sublime Text & Nodejs:** Download and install Sublime Text, Nodejs from their official website. Install both on your computer and ensure you click add to path when installing nodejs so 

2. **Open Sublime Text:** Launch Sublime Text.

3. **Create a New File:** Click on "File" > "New File" to create a new code file.

4. **Write JavaScript:** Write your JavaScript code in the new file.

5. **Save the File:** Save the file with a `.js` extension, like `myScript.js`.

6. **Run the Script:** In sublime text, you can press ctrl + b , or Open your computer's terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing your `.js` file, and use the `node` command to run it, like this: `node myScript.js`.

**3) Using Visual Studio Code (Without the Browser):**

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a powerful code editor. To use it for JavaScript programming without a browser:

1. **Install VSCode:** Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

2. **Open VSCode:** Launch VSCode.

3. **Create a New File:** Click on "File" > "New File" to create a new code file.

4. **Write JavaScript:** Write your JavaScript code in the new file.

5. **Save the File:** Save the file with a `.js` extension, like `myScript.js`.

6. **Run the Script:** Open your computer's terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing your `.js` file, and use the `node` command to run it, like this: `node myScript.js`.

These setups will help you practice and experiment with JavaScript code using different editors and environments.
