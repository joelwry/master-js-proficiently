   - b) otherwise if
   - c) elseif
   - d) else

   Answer: d) else

2. Question: What is the purpose of a conditional statement in programming?
   - a) To declare variables

3. Question: What is the output of the following code?

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   if (x < 5) {
     console.log("x is less than 5");
   } else if (x > 15) {
     console.log("x is greater than 15");
   } else {
     console.log("x is between 5 and 15");
   }
   ```

   - a) x is less than 5
   - b) x is greater than 15
   - c) x is between 5 and 15

   - d) It is executed only if there is no else if block.

   Answer: a) It is optional and can be omitted.

   - d) & (Bitwise AND)

   Answer: a) && (Logical AND)

## Loops

1. Question: What is the purpose of a loop in programming?
   - a) To define functions
   - b) To perform calculations
   - c) To repeat a block of code

   }
   ```

   - a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - b) 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
   - c) 1

   - b) while loop
   - c) do...while loop
   - d) loop

   Answer: c) do...while loop

5. Question: What does the loop condition determine?
   - a) The initial value of the loop variable
